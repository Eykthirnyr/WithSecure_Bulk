# WithSecure Batch Management Tool

WithSecure Batch Management Tool is a **multi-organization, multi-device** management utility that automates bulk operations via the WithSecure API. It allows administrators to efficiently manage security endpoints, execute operations, and export inventory data across multiple organizations.

This project is partly based on [WithSecure API Export Tool](https://github.com/Eykthirnyr/WithSecure_API_Export_Tool/tree/main), expanding its capabilities with a broader feature set.
